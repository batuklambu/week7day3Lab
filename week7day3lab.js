// UI/UX: Single Page Applications (SPA) are a great way to create a fantastic user experience on mobile devices.
// They consist of a single web page that loads all content using JavaScript. They request the markup and data independently and render pages straight to the browser.
// Reloading: Single-page applications are web pages that only require a single HTML page to load.
